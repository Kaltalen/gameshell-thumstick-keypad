# Gameshell Thumstick Keypad

A Project to add Thumbsticks to a Clockwork Gameshell.

## Getting Started

Work In Progress

This is somthing ive been playing around with.

Uses a Arduino Micro Pro.

Got it upto the stage where it was detected by windows as a gamepad and all buttons/thumsticks were detected correctly.

Yet to actually incorperate it into my gameshell. 

Includes:
- Arduino Sketch
- Eagle files for PCB
- STL files for printable case
